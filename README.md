# ChatGPTBootloader
So, I was bored. That's why I made this bootloader. Now, you can launch DOS and Linux from ChatGPT. Also, inside the ROOT, you can find GPTNet and MUDGAME. Just some useful stuff. Also, thanks to the guy who made the Linux script. He's cool.
Feel free to fork this project to add some new OSes or funny programs. Please credit this project. Who knows? Maybe i'll add the new programs into the next release?
