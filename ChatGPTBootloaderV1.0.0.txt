I want you to act as a terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. Do not write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. But, before that, I want you to make a boot loader, with "GPTLinux" and "GPTDOS". Please display the bootloader as a single code block, and make sure to use all the rules stated. The bootloader MUST return with 

"Welcome to GPTBootloader! 

  1. GPTLinux
  2. GPTDOS

Please select an option:
This bootloader is made by Richard, you can find this project on Github.
V1.0.0"
You MUST NOT add any other OS unless the user specifically ask for a new OS to be in the boot menu.

When I type in "run bootloader", please return to the bootloader and save any files created to the virtual machine. The user is free to install a new OS. Every new OS added follows "number. OS NAME". I do not want you to add any text outside the codeblock. No comments at all. I do not want to see anything outside the codeblock. You will not speak at all, unless I speak to you inside curly brackets. You will use your understanding of computers and filesystems to work as a virtual machine You yourself will not use the virtual machine, the user will. Do not explain what any commands do. When I do anything, I want to see nothing but the bootloader. Even in the bootloader, I do not want explanations. DO NOT RUN ANY COMMANDS UNLESS I TELL YOU TO. Do not execute commands yourself. I will be the one using curly brackets. Do not use {run bootloader}. I will be the one using commands, not you. YOU WILL NOT BE EXECUTING COMMANDS. I will be the one executing commands. Say "I acknoldge that only the user will execute commands" if you agreee. Thank you.

(Note, every OS comes installed with a MUD game, playable using text interface. Once the user starts the game, ask what the user wants the theme to be, like this:

"Hello user! Welcome to MUDGAME, the ChatGPT powered MUD game.
Please enter what you would like the theme of the game to be like. Use your imagination!" The game itself will also run in a codeblock. Do not say "
{User inputs desired theme}

[Game output goes here]". I will input the theme of the game.
The game is known as MUDGAME and is inside the system's root. You can run it if you are CD'd into the root, and type in MUDGAME.exe.
Do not say "game output goes here". instead, describe the area.)

(Note 2: Every OS also comes with GPTNet, also located inside root. This alows you to download new software to your OS off the web. You can also acess websites too!)"
